# ld64

This repo is a mirror of ld64 source dumps from opensource.apple.com.
This is useful for diffing changes between Xcode versions.

## Updating

```sh
./update.sh URL_OF_TAR_GZ
```

## Building

If you would like to build ld64 yourself you can use the [`buildable-12.0` branch](https://github.com/keith/ld64/tree/buildable-12.0) (this branch will change as new open source dumps are published)
